We consider various topics of natural motion generation as below, 

but not limited to:

- Task-oriented natural motion generation:
    - Natural motion for object grasping or manipulation.
    - Natural motion for locomotion.
- Task-agnostic natural motion generation:
    - Natural motion for gesture or expression.
    - Natural motion for interaction with humans.
- Bio-inspired/Human-inspired natural motion.
- Fundamental questions for natural motion
    - What is it, Why do we need it, When do we need it, and How can we make and use it.
- Mechanical design for natural motion.
- Advanced algorithms for natural motion.
